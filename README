Chichafortunes is a fortune app written using the Django Web Framework.

It can be used to power a site like http://fortunes.chicha.pe

Please read INSTALL and USAGE for more information

IMPORTANT: 

The following files and folders are NOT necessary since they are not
part of the 'fortunes' Django reusable app but might help you to
bootstrap a working site faster:

__init__.py
urls.py
settings.py
templates/

They are all part of a 'Django project' folder but you can use
your own.
