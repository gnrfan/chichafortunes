INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:

- You need Django 1.1 and a supported database (defaults to sqlite, mysql will do fine, postgresql might be a good pick)
- Install dependencies in your Python path (virtualenv suggested)
  - session_messages - Get it from http://code.google.com/p/django-session-messages/
- The reusable app is in the 'fortunes' folder
- The settings.py file as well as the urls.py and root templates folder are provided for your reference / convenience
- See and/or adjust database setup in the settings.py file
- Run python manage.py syncdb (you'll create the admin account and its credentials at this step)
- Run python manage.py runserver (for development stage is fine)
- Point your browser to the /admin/ interface and change the FQDN of your host from example.com to yoursite.domain
  under the Sites models in the domain property of the site with ID of 1
- Install properly under Apache or prefered web server (lighttpd, nginx or cherokee will do nice too)
   See: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/deployment/modpython/ (modwsgi works nicely too)

TODO: Turn this into something more useful for a non Django-savvy person
